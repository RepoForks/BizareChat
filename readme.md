### Design requirements

Application’s UI should be implemented based on Material Design principles. Next points should be taken into consideration during app’s design implementation:
* use Material Theme
* use native Android SDK’s UI widgets
* ripple effect should be implemented for all clickable elements (rows, buttons, clickable texts etc) for Android 5.0+
selected/unselected/enabled/disabled states should be implemented for all clickable elements for Android with version lower than 5.0
* use animations for changing UI elements’ properties (i. e. show/hide, move). Switching between screens should be also animated.
* User should be notified in case of background processes (network, db operations). Use loading indicators. Do not block UI with loading elements, User should always have possibility to navigate the app 
* User should be notified in case of any kind of errors occur
* Use Crouton and Toast UI Widgets
